### Committing Changes

After cloning the repository and completing your task, follow these steps to commit your changes:

1. Make sure you're in the root directory of the cloned repository in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Add your changes to the staging area using the following command:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

    This command adds all the changes you've made to your task files.

3. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message using the following command:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
    ```

    Replace `"Your commit message here"` with a brief description of the changes you've made.

4. Push your changes to the remote repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

    This command pushes your committed changes to the main branch of the repository.

That's it! Your changes have been submitted to the repository.
